# EigenFaces
Python version of a facial analysis program, using Principal Components Analysis (PCA)

PCA is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.

Calculating the covariance of the matrix and projecting the eigen vectors and values we were able to project images similar to original displays.
